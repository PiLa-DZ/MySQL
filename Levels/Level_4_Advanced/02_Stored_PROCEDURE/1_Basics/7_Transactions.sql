-- == ======================================================
-- == Transactions (ACID properties)
-- -- This is the most critical part of Database Design. 
-- -- A transaction ensures that a group of SQL commands either all succeed or all fail.

-- START TRANSACTION --> Begins the recording.
-- COMMIT            --> Saves changes permanently.
-- ROLLBACK          --> Undoes everything if something goes wrong.
