- you have two choices.
    1. The "Old" Way: 
        - Download the MariaDB installer for Windows/Mac/Linux and run it.
    2. The "Pro" Way (Docker): 
        - This is what you should learn. 
        - Instead of installing MariaDB directly on your computer 
        - (which makes it "dirty" with files), 
        - you run it in a Container.
