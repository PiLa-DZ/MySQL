- When to "Denormalize"?
    - In modern Big Data (like Data Warehousing), 
        - we sometimes deliberately break these rules 
        - to make SELECT queries faster by avoiding 10 different joins. 
    - This is called Denormalization, 
        - but you should only do it after you've mastered Normalization first!
