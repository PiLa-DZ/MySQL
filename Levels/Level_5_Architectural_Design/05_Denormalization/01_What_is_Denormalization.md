- 🚀 What is Denormalization?
    - Denormalization is the intentional process of 
        - adding redundant data to a database 
        - to speed up complex queries.
    - In a normalized database, 
        - you might have to JOIN 5 tables to get a simple invoice. 
        - If you have 10 million users, 
        - that JOIN will be slow. 
        - Denormalization says: 
            - "Let's just save the Customer Name directly 
            - inside the Orders table 
            - so we don't have to JOIN anything."
