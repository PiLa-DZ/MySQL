Prisma_Module
Summary: CLI Tool 

More Details:
npm install prisma (The Architect)
Think of this as your Construction Toolset.
It is a CLI (Command Line Interface): It only lives in your terminal.
Its job: To manage your database schema, run migrations, and "pull" from existing databases.
Analogy: It's the blueprint and the heavy machinery. You use it to build the house, but you don't live inside it.
Why it's a "Dev Dependency" (--save-dev): Because once your app is running on a server (production), you don't need the tools to build the database anymore; you just need the database to be there.
